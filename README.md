## Online Cars Sale Marketplace Data Set Analysis Plan ##

This dataset contains the car sale listings on a popular online auto marketplace. The Cars sales and market place data consists of listings of vehicles on a website. The data has over 9000 different listings from various dealers and private sellers across the country. Our group was tasked with exploring this raw data to find insights that would be valuable to prospecting purchasers and dealers on the site. 

# Questions that our group will answer: #

Question 1 (Most Popular Cars) -> Chris using Python
Question 2  (Difference between private sellers and dealers) -> Angie using Python
Question 3 (Where are the most used/new cars) -> Barbara using RStudio
Question 4 ( Is it better to buy from private seller or dealer)
Question 5 ( Does Price Vary by Region, what region is best for buying or sellling, etc?) -> Kris
